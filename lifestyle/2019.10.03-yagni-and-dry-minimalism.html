    Last year, everyone was talking about Marie Kondo.  Her feelings-driven approach to minimalism (KonMari) made the process fun, and it made the Netflix documentary that followed her through people’s homes fascinating.  Viewers looked around them at all the stuff they’d collected, grabbed anything that ranged between bums-me-out, and no-feelings-at-all, threw it in a bag and donated it.  Donation centers exploded with anything that didn’t “spark joy” and America’s houses lightened their loads a bit.
</p>
<p>
    A few months later they went to IKEA to buy a garbage can and filled their carts up again with anything that sparked joy in that moment.

    Not long before, Americans were fascinated with another docu-series about shedding material goods — Hoarders.  Hoarders focuses on helping homeowners struggling with mental health issues clean their cluttered, often-dangerous homes.  Every episode, you see the subjects agonize over the loss of literal trash, hugging crumbling newspapers and candy wrappers to their chests and telling the stories they associate with the objects.

    The Marie Kondo approach to decluttering has never sat well with me, and as I considered Hoarders in this context, the reason became clear to me.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">
    Rooting your joy in objects is neither healthy nor a meaningful measure of necessity.
</p>
<p>
    I like the idea of owning less.  When I look back on my life, some of the most meaningful times came when I owned the least.  So when my wife adopted the KonMari method of decluttering, I applauded the decluttering, but resisted joining.  She continued the reduction trend, adopting the “capsule wardrobe,” donating and selling the rest of her wardrobe.  The breadth of her possessions became more meaningful and focused, but her joy didn’t come because the remaining items brought her joy.
</p>
<p>
    She was shedding the lie that possessing more fostered the freedom of options.
</p>
<p>
    As I thought about it, it occurred to me there are decluttering concepts in software design that can also apply to personal possessions.
</p>

<h2>
    YAGNI – You Ain’t Gonna Need It
</h2>
<p>
        The idea is that you should not introduce anything into your software until you actually need it.  By doing this, you can drastically eliminate the need to maintain systems that are adding nothing.
</p>
<p>
    When I was 17, I worked at Best Buy and got a smokin’ deal on a set of Athena AS-B1 bookshelf speakers.  I’ve loved and used them for 15 years.  That is, until last year, when bought smaller (if inferior) speakers.  I told myself I’d set up a listening area with them in the loft, but we don’t even use the loft, let alone listen to music right next to where the baby sleeps.
</p>
<p>
    It pains me deeply to say it, but they’ve gotta go.  They bring me joy.  I still feel warm and fuzzy when I hear that first chord of Morning Phase through them.  But I have no meaningful plan for them.
</p>
<p>
    I can’t hang onto something just because I can imagine a scenario where it would be the perfect thing.
</p>
<h2>
    DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself
</h2>
<p>
    You can further eliminate the burden of unnecessary maintenance by combining solutions when you are solving the same problem multiple times (DRY — don’t repeat yourself).  Rather than give software examples, let’s jump right into material goods examples.
</p>
<p>
    Having grown up as a video gamer, I love picking up old games and playing them again.  It’s a combination of nostalgia and appreciation for classic game design.  As a result, however, I have a lot of old video games in their original cartridge form.  As part of decluttering, I took a hard look at the old carts collecting dust on the top shelf in my office.
</p>
<p>
    There was a lot of YAGNI there…
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Super R-Type — standard YAGNI</li>
    <li>Robocop vs. Terminator — hilarious YAGNI</li>
    <li>Gradius 3 — painful YAGNI</li>
    <li>Uniracers — indifferent YAGNI</li>
    <li>The Lion King — nostalgic YAGNI</li>
</ul>

    But within this, there was another other category.  Games I genuinely still enjoyed playing a few times a year or so.  Mostly first-party Nintendo titles — Super Mario World, Super Metroid, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  Recently, however, Nintendo Switch Online began offering Super Nintendo games as part of their subscription package, so enough of these games became available there, that the cartridges simply became redundant.
</p>
<p>
    There were a few missing third-party games — NBA Jam, Blackthorne, Joust, Final Fight — that I would miss, but realistically I would have no trouble living without.  Many of these of these spark joy because of the friends with whom I played them, but if I want to feel that joy, I should just friggin call them up and we can laugh about it.
</p>
<p>
    So the Super Nintendo and the associated game carts are all gone now. I kept one USB SNES-style controller for playing on emulators.
