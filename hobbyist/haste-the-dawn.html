    Have you head of Tower of Goo? No, I didn't make it. But when I found out where it came from,
    <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com">The Experimental Gameplay Project</a>, I couldn't wait
    to throw my hat into the ring.

<p>
    Per the rules of EGP, I spent 7 days from concept to completion making a game following the theme
    'Night and Day.'
</p>
<p>
    The game is a puzzle platformer built on my custom SlonArch engine.  The graphics were hand-drawn
    with Sharpie, then photographed and colored in Photoshop.
