<p>In 2014, I built a wave-survival shmup called Super Clarity Blast for a community creativity fair in  Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The engine is written in C++, the game and UI logic is written in Lua, and the shaders are built with GLSL. It supports keyboard/mouse input, as well as gamepads, with up to 4 players collaborating simultaneously.</p>
<p>With this project, I learned the value of a deadline, and the need to make tough cuts in order to maintain product quality and developer sanity.  The game was built in just two weeks</p>
