    Lunchlady and Sloppy Joe are what run this site.
</p>
<p>
    Every time I had to do anything custom in Wordpress, I...well, I just didn't.  It was never
    neither fun nor rewarding.  I knew that I'd never use 90% of what it did, and yet
    I was still paying for the overhead of wrestling with it to run my site.
</p>
<p>
    Looking for a project that would expand on my existing knowledge of
    Node, React, and Redux, I set the whole thing up to be backed by static JSON and HTML,
    served up by lunchlady, a Node-based command-line tool.

    Lunchlady will pull down the source of sloppy-joe and combine it with your
    site's data to generate a single-page app with dynamically-loaded content and theming.
