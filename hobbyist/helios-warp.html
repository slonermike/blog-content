    In 2015, I built a Tron-inspired infinite runner game in Unity for iPhone -- Helios Warp.  I worked with
    synthwave artists to feature their music, exchanging free use of their music in for driving
    traffic through the game to their music sharing sites.

    In 2016, I reworked the game to run on a PC with custom arcade controls, and the game was housed in
    a local arcade for a month.  All the proceeds went to a local charity.  The game was again featured at
    the 2017 Northwest Pinball & Arcade Expo.

    The iPhone version of the game is no longer available (I did not renew my Apple developer license), but
    if you are interested in playing, let me know -- the arcade version is playable on desktops.
