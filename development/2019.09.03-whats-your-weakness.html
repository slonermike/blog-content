<p>When I was interviewing as a college graduate, I heard this question more than once.  Eight years later, I found I was still being asked the same question.  It’s become a cliché.  “What’s your greatest weakness?”  As an interviewer, I have come to understand why it gets asked so much — liars love to lie about it.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more cliché than the question itself is the all-too-common response: “I care too much.”  In an effort to avoid the heart of the question, candidates will often attempt to deflect the question by talking about their strengths.  When this happens, I find myself keenly aware that they’re either being dishonest with themselves or with me.  My money’s on the latter.</p>

<p>Tell the truth.</p>

<p>This question is easy to answer if you know yourself, and terrifying if you don’t.  It gives you an opportunity to share how you’ve grown, and the ways in which you see yourself continuing to grow. The interviewer isn’t looking for you to out yourself.  They want to know that you are self-aware, realistic, and growth-oriented.  They also want to know you’re not full of crap.  It’s one of those things that liars eagerly lie about, thus outing themselves as liars.  Everyone knows you’re lying, so skip that path and be honest.</p>

<p>Share ways in which you’ve mitigated or grown out of you weaknesses, and continue into the ways you plan to grow in the future.  Employers know you’re imperfect, but don’t know whether you’re on a growth path.  Show them that.</p>

<h2>For Interviewers</h2>
<p>While I think the answer can tell you a lot about a person, I don’t ask it anymore.  It can make the candidate’s experience feel boilerplate and unmemorable.  I want candidates to leave knowing that we’re a creative team with a unique perspective.  I have other questions I ask to try and nudge the bullshit meter, and I’ll cover those in a later post.</p>

<p>That said, I don’t think it’s a bad question to ask.  Just don’t ask it unplanned.  Find out what everyone in the interview loop is asking (and has asked, if you do multiple interviews) and slot it in among more interesting and unique questions.  For those who answer sincerely, it can be an encouraging way to find candidates who are self-aware, honest, and growth-oriented enough to provide thoughtful answers.  You may even learn something about yourself in the process.</p>
