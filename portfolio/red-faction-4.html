    For <i>Red Faction: Armageddon</i> I stepped into a more tools-focused role as a gameplay
    developer.  With this a more linear, mission-focused game, we wanted to put as much power
    directly into the hands of the designers as possible.

    Initially, the project was conceived as <i>Red Faction: Crusade</i>, a hub-and-spoke, open-world
    follow-up to <i>Red Faction: Guerrilla</i>.  For that concept, I worked on in-editor tools for
    configuring quest-style gameplay.

    Additionally, we had taken consideration of criticism that the world in Guerrilla had been a bit lifeless,
    and to help alleviate this problem, I created a system to marry the destruction and restoration engine
    with our animation systems, allowing complex, animated machinery to be destroyed and repaired by the player.

    When the game concept turned away from open-world and toward linear gameplay, the quest system was dropped in
    favor of pursuing a node-based visual scripting tool to be used by our designers and artists, who would
    otherwise need to schedule programmer time to make even the smallest changes.  This allowed them to iterate
    faster and do some truly creative and inspiring things with their ideas.
