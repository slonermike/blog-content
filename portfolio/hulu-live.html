    Hulu with Live TV is an OTT delivery of both VOD and Digital MVPD (linear TV stream) content
    in a single experience -- providing extensive personalization, DVR capabilities, and wrangling
    an enormous content library into a uniform browse & playback experience.

    In 2016-2017, I collaborated with Living Room team to develop a brand new Hulu app from nothing to fully-functional using CoffeeScript (and
    later TypeScript) in a single-page format with HTML5 and SASS visuals, and custom
    platform bindings for scrolling animations.

    Since then, I have worked with product and client teams to carefully review and implement our evolving designs,
    working out ways to optimize the experience for all users -- maintaining a high-quality
    experience, regardless of device power.

    I have also collaborated with the design and product teams to define our design patterns and developer
    needs for design documentation.  This lead to a move toward a version-controlled component library,
    allowing design to continue working on in-progress designs while development implements fully-vetted
    previous versions.

    I am the development lead for the preview program, which delivers early-access builds to Hulu
    employees and partners.  This allows us to try new features in real-world scenarios and gather
    user feedback and error reporting for features which have not yet been released.
