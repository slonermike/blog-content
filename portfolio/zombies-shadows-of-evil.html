    With <i>Shadows of Evil</i>, we wanted to make sure the pack-in Zombie map
    for <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> was something with a unique feel and
    identity.  We included the mainstays of the series -- an unlockable map-traversing
    vehicle, wonder weapons, easter eggs, and puzzles.  But to that, we introduced
    a mix of noir and Lovecraftian horror.

    For this project, I worked on nearly every aspect, including gameplay systems, weapons,
    character and story development.  My primary focus was again on the player's quest
    to build the wonder weapons and the puzzles and challenges associated with that quest.
