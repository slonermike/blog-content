    In 2011, I joined the team at Treyarch, and began work on the sequel to the
    hugely-successful <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i>.
</p>
<p>
    I worked as both a designer and scripter for the <i>Odysseus</i> story mission, collaborating
    with nearly every discipline -- producers, artists, writers, programmers -- to deliver a top-notch
    cinematic gameplay experience.

    Later in the project, I provided scripting support for the RTS-style Strike Force missions and the associated
    mission hub, built in the same environment as the <i>Odysseus</i> mission.
