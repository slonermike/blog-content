    For <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i>, we were making our way back to putting 4-player cooperative
    play back at the center of the experience.  I worked with a team of scripters and level designers to
    produce experimental prototypes that made use unique use of cooperative play.  Ultimately, these ideas
    were taken from the prototypes and applied across the story campaign.
