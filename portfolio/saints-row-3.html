    Near the end of development of <i>Saints Row 3</i>, I was brought onto the team
    to assist with polishing story and side missions.  I provided "Additional Programming"
    support on the following gameplay experiences.
    <ul>
        <li>Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax</li>
        <li>Guardian Angel</li>
        <li>Tiger Escort</li>
        <li>Insurance Fraud</li>
    </ul>
