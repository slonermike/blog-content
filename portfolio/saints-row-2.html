    From 2007-2008, I worked on <i>Saints Row 2</i>, which was my first project out of college.
</p>
<p>
    I focused primarily on gameplay systems, side missions (Activities and Diversions), and occasionally, story
    missions, working closely with designers to convert a technical design document, to
    a playable prototype, and eventually to a polished, shippable state.
</p>
<p>
    Saints Row 2 presented unique challenges in that all gameplay modes supported untethered co-op gameplay,
    further complicated by its use of a fully-featured rigid-body physics engine in a streaming, open world.
</p>
<p>
    I worked on the following side missions, and in the case of <i>Trail Blazing</i>, provided significant
    design direction.
    <ul>
        <li>Fight Club</li>
        <li>Septic Avenger</li>
        <li>FUZZ</li>
        <li>Trail Blazing</li>
        <li>Chop Shop</li>
        <li>Taxi Driver</li>
        <li>Driving Stunts</li>
        <li>Blackjack & Poker</li>
        <li>Streaking</li>
    </ul>
